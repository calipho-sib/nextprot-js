# Overview
---
All entry pages contain an overview section at the top of the page summarizing the identity and history of the protein(s) described in the entry.

Use the **Extend overview** and **Collapse view** buttons to toggle between two formats:

* **Basic**
* **Extended** 

## Basic

This is the format shown by default. Displayed, in order, from top to bottom, are:

#### Protein also known as:
The full alternative protein name for the entry.
- If the entry has multiple full alternative names, the longest is displayed.  
- If the entry has an INN name or CD antigen, they are displayed respectively preceded by "International Nonproprietary Name" or "CD antigen"
#### Cleaved into: 
All full protein chain names for the entry in alphanumerical order.
#### Gene name:
All primary gene names for the entry in alphanumerical order.
#### Family name:
All family names displayed hierarchichal order (Superfamily > Family > Subfamily).
#### Protein existence.


## Extended

The extended overview format displays all protein, gene, family names, as well as the full history of the entry and the evidence on which the protein(s) existence is based. Displayed, in order, from top to bottom, are: 

### Protein

##### Recommended names. 
These are listed in the following order:

- Allergen. Example: [NX_P02538](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P02538)
##### Chain names
These are listed in the same order as protein names:
- **Recommended names** (in order): Full, EC, short.
- **Alternative names** (in order): Full, EC, short, CD antigen, INN, allergen. Examples: [NX_P06213](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P06213) [NX_P51659](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P51659)
##### Functional regions. 
These are listed in the same order as protein names:
- **Recommended names** (in order): Full, EC, short.
- **Alternative names** (in order): Full, EC, short, CD antigen, INN, allergen. Examples: [NX_P26439](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P26439/) [NX_O60513](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_O60513/)
##### Isoform names
These are listed in the following order: 
- **Recommended names**. Multiple isoform names are listed in alphanumerical order. Example: [NX_P26439](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P26439/) 
- **Alternative names**. Example: [NX_P06213](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P06213/)

### Gene
It is possible for an entry not to have an associated gene name. Example: [NX_P0DMU3](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P0DMU3/). Gene names are listed in the following order: 
- **Primary**. Multiple primary gene names are listed in alphanumerical order. Example: [NX_P62805](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P62805/) 
- **Synonym**. Multiple gene synonyms are listed in alphanumerical order. Example: [NX_P09919](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P09919/)

### Family
An entry may not have an associated family name, i.e. [NX_O00154](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_O00154/), or it may be associated with multiple family names, i.e. []().  
Family names are listed in the following order:
- **Superfamily** : Example with a superfamily, family and subfamily: [NX_P06213](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P06213/)
- **Family** : Example with only one family: [NX_P0DMU3](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P0DMU3/)
- **Subfamily**
